# ansible-vault-sandbox

[jmgrady/ansible-vault-sandbox](https://github.com/jmgrady/ansible-vault-sandbox)
is a sandbox for learning how to configure `git` to use `ansible-vault` for comparing
_Ansible_ vault files.

The following patterns are setup as filenames for files that are encrypted using
`ansible-vault`:

- `*vault*`
- `*priv*`
- `*secret*`
